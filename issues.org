#+FILETAGS: :test: 
* Horg
  :program:
  A haskell program for parsing org-mode files. An org-mode file is read an
  a record is created from it. It contains the title, content, tags, 
  properties and all subheadings.
** parsing
   :PROPERTIES:
   :myproperty: a property value
   :anotherproperty: another property value
   :END:
*** DONE PROPERTY parsing stucks
*** parse file headers
**** DONE FILETAGS
*** TODO dates
    a date time library must be used here!
**** TODO SCHEDULED
**** TODO DEADLINE
**** TODO CLOSED
**** TODO LOGBOOK
     very very similar to properties.
**** TODO timestamps
*** DONE TODO states
    implementation: if the first word of the title line is written in capital 
    letters, it is used as state.
    problems:
    - it is not used, if it the title consists of only one word.
    - unresolved issue: e.g. * JSON output. JSON would be a state in that 
      case.

** modifying
*** purpose
    functionality of an agenda can be easily provided.
*** DONE a traversal function is needed
    for considering different TODO states, filetags and categories. I'm going 
    to try to make in an instance of the traversable typeclass.
    Update:
    I can't make it an instance, because I need parameterized data type!
    Also, for tags, this is not useful, because tags are inherited into the 
    subtrees anyway.
** Output
*** JSON
*** DOT
*** Org-Mode
    Using the the functionality of =modifying=, custom reports may be created 
    and saved in other org-mode files. For example filtering with respect to 
    some =property=. An application could be, to have a giant org-mode file, 
    containing the logging of a program creation, with feature descriptions, 
    issue tracking, also finished issues. A README file or an TODO file can 
    then be provided.
**** TODO showContent
     must be modified in a way, such that line break occur only at spaces and 
     line length does not exceed 80 chars.
** bugs
*** DONE often there is a leading empty tag!
    problem solved by removing all empty lines.
*** DONE there are problem with T.head when an empty line follows the title
    problem solved by removing all empty lines.
*** DONE there is also a problem, when there is no line between to headings
    the Data.List.Split module behaves strange, could break again in future
*** DONE head error when there is no file meta data
